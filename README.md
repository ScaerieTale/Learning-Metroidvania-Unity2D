# Untitled Metroidvania Game

Catchy title, huh?  This is yet another learning to game dev project.  This time, I actually remembered to launch the git repository BEFORE writing a scrap of code.  I haven't even imported assets yet.

This project is quite literally just a blank Unity 2D core project, this readme file, and a Unity-sanctioned .gitignore file currently.


It is my hope that as this project progresses, I can show off a little bit of my skill and ability gained over the past year and a half of studying programming, and a lifetime of studying video games as a consumer :D

So, yeah, lower your expectations appropriately!  But I actually plan to create a finished product with this project, even if it is still just a demo project. <3
